Sure, here's an example IELTS speaking part 2 answer about the topic "Talk about an advertisement that you remember":

One advertisement that I remember vividly is a TV commercial for a chocolate brand that aired a few years ago. The ad featured a young boy who was sitting in a park, feeling sad and lonely. He was holding a chocolate bar, but he didn't feel like eating it. Suddenly, a group of children appeared and invited him to play with them. The boy smiled and joined the group, and they all started playing together.

The message of the ad was that the chocolate was not just a delicious treat, but it could also bring people together and create happy moments. It was a powerful message, and it resonated with me. The ad was simple yet effective, and it left a lasting impression on me.

What I liked about the ad was that it wasn't just trying to sell a product, but it was also promoting a positive message about friendship and kindness. It made me feel good about the brand and the values it stood for. The ad was so memorable that I even bought the chocolate brand a few times after seeing it.

Overall, the advertisement was a great example of how a simple yet powerful message can make a lasting impact on people. It showed me that advertising can be more than just promoting a product, but it can also promote positive values and messages that can inspire and connect people.
