### Additional Tips:
- **Speak from the heart**: When discussing memories, it's natural to include emotions. Use phrases like "I felt," "It made me happy," or "I was scared but excited."
- **Use the past tense**: Since you're talking about the past, ensure you use the past tense of verbs (e.g., "played," "visited," "thought").
- **Include details**: The more specific you are, the more engaging your story will be. Mention names, places, and sensory details (sights, sounds, smells).
- **Practice storytelling**: Try to tell your memories as a story with a beginning, middle, and end. This will make your narrative more compelling.
- **Ask and answer questions**: Engage in conversations about childhood by asking questions like "What was your favorite game?" or "Where did you spend most of your time as a child?"

By incorporating these verbs, phrases, and expressions into your practice, you can create rich, detailed narratives about your childhood memories. Remember, the key to fluency is practice, so keep speaking and refining your language skills.
