Sure, here's an example IELTS speaking part 2 answer about the topic "Describe a time when you first met someone":

I remember the first time I met my best friend in college. It was during the first week of classes, and we had both signed up for a study group for our math class. I was a bit nervous about meeting new people, but I was excited to have some help with the class.

When I walked into the study group, I saw a group of people sitting around a table, and I immediately noticed my future best friend. She had a warm smile and introduced herself to me. We started chatting about the class, and I found out that we had a lot in common, including our love for music and movies.

As we worked on the math problems together, I realized that my new friend was not only intelligent but also had a great sense of humor. We laughed and joked around, and the study group turned into a fun hangout session. After the study group ended, we exchanged phone numbers and continued to hang out outside of class.

Looking back, that first meeting was the start of a wonderful friendship that has lasted for years. I'm grateful that we were both in that study group and had the opportunity to meet each other. It taught me that sometimes, the people we meet unexpectedly can become some of the most important people in our lives.

Overall, meeting my best friend for the first time was a memorable occasion for me, and it showed me the power of making connections with new people.
